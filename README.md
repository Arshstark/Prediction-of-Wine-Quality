# Prediction-of-Wine-Quality
To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10

# Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:

--> To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
--> To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine

# Steps included in this project:
Importing Lib
Loading Data
Understanding Data
Missing Values
Exploring Variables(Data Anylasis)
Feature Selection
Proportion of Good vs Bad Wines
Preparing Data for Modelling
Applying different models
Choosing right model
Hurray you just completed the task !
